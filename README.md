# Design Patterns

## Description
This repository implements all of the design patterns of Gang of Four (GoF). Below you can see all of the design patterns:
- **Creational**: Abstract Factory, Builder, Factory Method, Prototype e Singleton.
- **Structural**: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Fa√ßade, Flyweight e Proxy.
- **Behavioural**: Chain of responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template method e Visitor.

**Creational** is used to abstract the process of how an object is created in the application.

**Structural** is used in class composition and object composition.

**Behavioural** category on how classes and objects interact and distribute responsibilities in the application.

### Creational
- **Singleton**: Ensure that a class has only one instance in the program and provide a global access point for it.
- **Abstract Factory**:
- **Builder**:
- **Factory Method**:
- **Prototype**:

## Principle of design object oriented (SOLID)
- **Single Responsability Principle**: one class have only one reason to change
- **Open/closed principle**: class, object and methods most be open to extension, but closed for changes.
- **Liskov substitution principle**: derived classes most be able to override totaly base-class.
- **Interface segregation principle**: clients should not be forced to rely on interfaces they dont use.
- **Deprendency inversion principle**: Modules of high-level should not be rely of modules of low-level. Both must be rely of abstractions. Details mast be rely of abstractions, not the other way around.

## PS:
All of design patterns will be implemented in TypeScript.
